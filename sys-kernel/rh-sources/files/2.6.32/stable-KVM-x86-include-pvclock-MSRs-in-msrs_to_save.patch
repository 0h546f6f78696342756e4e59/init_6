Subject: [stable] KVM: x86: include pvclock MSRs in msrs_to_save
Bugzilla: 555084

(Pulled from -stable series)

commit e3267cbbbfbcbe9c18833e89b10beabb1117cb55 upstream.

For a while now, we are issuing a rdmsr instruction to find out which
msrs in our save list are really supported by the underlying machine.
However, it fails to account for kvm-specific msrs, such as the pvclock
ones.

This patch moves then to the beginning of the list, and skip testing them.
