LIMITED WARRANTY: LICENSOR warrants to you (if you are the initial and
original purchaser of the Software) that the original storage medium
holding the Software is free from defects in material and workmanship
under normal use and service for 90 days from the date of purchase. If
for any reason you find a defect in the storage medium during the
warranty period, LICENSOR agrees to replace, free of charge, any
Software discovered to be defective within the warranty period as long
as the Software is currently being manufactured by LICENSOR. If the
Software is no longer available, LICENSOR retains the right to
substitute a similar program of equal or greater value. This warranty
is limited to the storage medium containing the Software as originally
provided by LICENSOR and is not applicable to normal wear and tear.
This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the defect
has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or neglect. Any implied
warranties prescribed by statute are expressly limited to the 90-day
period described above. 
Except as set forth above, this warranty is in lieu of all other
warranties, whether oral or written, express or implied, including any
other warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or
non-infringement, and no other representations or warranties of any
kind shall be binding on LICENSOR.
When returning the Software subject to the limited warranty above,
please send the original Software only to the LICENSOR address
specified below and include: your name and return address; a photocopy
of your dated sales receipt; and a brief note describing the defect and
the system on which you are running the Software.
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM POSSESSION, USE OR
MALFUNCTION OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING DAMAGES TO PROPERTY,
LOSS OF GOODWILL, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION AND, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR'S LIABILITY
SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ACTUAL PRICE PAID FOR USE OF THE SOFTWARE. SOME
STATES/COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED
WARRANTY LASTS AND/OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND/OR EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU
SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM
JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.
